<img alt="253.jpg (112K)" src="images/253.jpg" height="603" width="780">
<br><br>

<p>  King Leir once ruled in this land<br>
    With princely power and peace;<br>
  And had all things with hearts content,<br>
    That might his joys increase.<br>
  Amongst those things that nature gave,<br>
    Three daughters fair had he,<br>
  So princely seeming beautiful,<br>
    As fairer could not be.</p>

<p>  So on a time it pleas'd the king<br>
    A question thus to move,<br>
  Which of his daughters to his grace<br>
    Could shew the dearest love:<br>
  For to my age you bring content,<br>
    Quoth he, then let me hear,<br>
  Which of you three in plighted troth<br>
    The kindest will appear.</p>

<p>  To whom the eldest thus began;<br>
    Dear father, mind, quoth she,<br>
  Before your face, to do you good,<br>
    My blood shall render'd be:<br>
  And for your sake my bleeding heart<br>
    Shall here be cut in twain,<br>
  Ere that I see your reverend age<br>
    The smallest grief sustain.</p>

<p>  And so will I, the second said;<br>
    Dear father, for your sake,<br>
  The worst of all extremities<br>
    I'll gently undertake:<br>
  And serve your highness night and day<br>
    With diligence and love;<br>
  That sweet content and quietness<br>
    Discomforts may remove.</p>

<p>  In doing so, you glad my soul,<br>
    The aged king reply'd;<br>
  But what sayst thou, my youngest girl,<br>
    How is thy love ally'd?<br>
  My love (quoth young Cordelia then)<br>
    Which to your grace I owe,<br>
  Shall be the duty of a child,<br>
    And that is all I'll show.</p>

<p>  And wilt thou shew no more, quoth he,<br>
    Than doth thy duty bind?<br>
  I well perceive thy love is small,<br>
    When as no more I find.<br>
  Henceforth I banish thee my court,<br>
    Thou art no child of mine;<br>
  Nor any part of this my realm<br>
    By favour shall be thine.</p>

<p>  Thy elder sisters loves are more<br>
    Then well I can demand,<br>
  To whom I equally bestow<br>
    My kingdome and my land,<br>
  My pompal state and all my goods,<br>
    That lovingly I may<br>
  With those thy sisters be maintain'd<br>
    Until my dying day.</p>

<p>  Thus flattering speeches won renown,<br>
    By these two sisters here;<br>
  The third had causeless banishment,<br>
    Yet was her love more dear:<br>
  For poor Cordelia patiently<br>
    Went wandring up and down,<br>
  Unhelp'd, unpity'd, gentle maid,<br>
    Through many an English town:</p>

<p>  Untill at last in famous France<br>
    She gentler fortunes found;<br>
  Though poor and bare, yet she was deem'd<br>
    The fairest on the ground:<br>
  Where when the king her virtues heard,<br>
    And this fair lady seen,<br>
  With full consent of all his court<br>
    He made his wife and queen.</p>

<p>  Her father king Leir this while<br>
    With his two daughters staid:<br>
  Forgetful of their promis'd loves,<br>
    Full soon the same decay'd;<br>
  And living in queen Ragan's court,<br>
    The eldest of the twain,<br>
  She took from him his chiefest means,<br>
    And most of all his train.</p>

<p>  For whereas twenty men were wont<br>
    To wait with bended knee:<br>
  She gave allowance but to ten,<br>
    And after scarce to three;<br>
  Nay, one she thought too much for him;<br>
    So took she all away,<br>
  In hope that in her court, good king,<br>
    He would no longer stay.</p>

<p>  Am I rewarded thus, quoth he,<br>
    In giving all I have<br>
  Unto my children, and to beg<br>
    For what I lately gave?<br>
  I'll go unto my Gonorell:<br>
    My second child, I know,<br>
  Will be more kind and pitiful,<br>
    And will relieve my woe.</p>

<p>  Full fast he hies then to her court;<br>
    Where when she heard his moan<br>
  Return'd him answer, That she griev'd<br>
    That all his means were gone:<br>
  But no way could relieve his wants;<br>
    Yet if that he would stay<br>
  Within her kitchen, he should have<br>
    What scullions gave away.</p>

<p>  When he had heard, with bitter tears,<br>
    He made his answer then;<br>
  In what I did let me be made<br>
    Example to all men.<br>
  I will return again, quoth he,<br>
    Unto my Ragan's court;<br>
  She will not use me thus, I hope,<br>
    But in a kinder sort.</p>

<p>  Where when he came, she gave command<br>
    To drive him thence away:<br>
  When he was well within her court<br>
    (She said) he would not stay.<br>
  Then back again to Gonorell<br>
    The woeful king did hie,<br>
  That in her kitchen he might have<br>
    What scullion boy set by.</p>

<p>  But there of that he was deny'd,<br>
    Which she had promis'd late:<br>
  For once refusing, he should not<br>
    Come after to her gate.<br>
  Thus twixt his daughters, for relief<br>
    He wandred up and down;<br>
  Being glad to feed on beggars food,<br>
    That lately wore a crown.</p>

<p>  And calling to remembrance then<br>
    His youngest daughters words,<br>
  That said the duty of a child<br>
    Was all that love affords:<br>
  But doubting to repair to her,<br>
    Whom he had banish'd so,<br>
  Grew frantick mad; for in his mind<br>
    He bore the wounds of woe:</p>

<p>  Which made him rend his milk-white locks,<br>
    And tresses from his head,<br>
  And all with blood bestain his cheeks,<br>
    With age and honour spread.<br>
  To hills and woods and watry founts<br>
    He made his hourly moan,<br>
  Till hills and woods and sensless things,<br>
    Did seem to sigh and groan.</p>

<p>  Even thus possest with discontents,<br>
    He passed o're to France,<br>
  In hopes from fair Cordelia there,<br>
    To find some gentler chance;<br>
  Most virtuous dame! which when she heard,<br>
    Of this her father's grief,<br>
  As duty bound, she quickly sent<br>
    Him comfort and relief:<br></p>

<p>  And by a train of noble peers,<br>
    In brave and gallant sort,<br>
  She gave in charge he should be brought<br>
    To Aganippus' court;<br>
  Whose royal king, with noble mind<br>
    So freely gave consent,<br>
  To muster up his knights at arms,<br>
    To fame and courage bent.</p>

<p>  And so to England came with speed,<br>
    To repossesse king Leir<br>
  And drive his daughters from their thrones<br>
    By his Cordelia dear.<br>
  Where she, true-hearted noble queen,<br>
    Was in the battel slain;<br>
  Yet he, good king, in his old days,<br>
    Possest his crown again.</p>

<p>  But when he heard Cordelia's death,<br>
    Who died indeed for love<br>
  Of her dear father, in whose cause<br>
    She did this battle move;<br>
  He swooning fell upon her breast,<br>
    From whence he never parted:<br>
  But on her bosom left his life,<br>
    That was so truly hearted.</p>

<p>  The lords and nobles when they saw<br>
    The end of these events,<br>
  The other sisters unto death<br>
    They doomed by consents;<br>
  And being dead, their crowns they left<br>
    Unto the next of kin:<br>
  Thus have you seen the fall of pride,<br>
    And disobedient sin.</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p>  He did not wear his scarlet coat,<br>
    For blood and wine are red,<br>
  And blood and wine were on his hands<br>
    When they found him with the dead,<br>
  The poor dead woman whom he loved,<br>
    And murdered in her bed.</p>

<p>  He walked amongst the Trial Men<br>
    In a suit of shabby grey;<br>
  A cricket cap was on his head,<br>
    And his step seemed light and gay;<br>
  But I never saw a man who looked<br>
    So wistfully at the day.</p>

<p>  I never saw a man who looked<br>
    With such a wistful eye<br>
  Upon that little tent of blue<br>
    Which prisoners call the sky,<br>
  And at every drifting cloud that went<br>
    With sails of silver by.</p>

<p>  I walked, with other souls in pain,<br>
    Within another ring,<br>
  And was wondering if the man had done<br>
    A great or little thing,<br>
  When a voice behind me whispered low,<br>
    <i>"That fellow's got to swing."</i></p>

<p>  Dear Christ! the very prison walls<br>
    Suddenly seemed to reel,<br>
  And the sky above my head became<br>
    Like a casque of scorching steel;<br>
  And, though I was a soul in pain,<br>
    My pain I could not feel.</p>

<p>  I only knew what hunted thought<br>
    Quickened his step, and why<br>
  He looked upon the garish day<br>
    With such a wistful eye;<br>
  The man had killed the thing he loved,<br>
    And so he had to die.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  Yet each man kills the thing he loves,<br>
    By each let this be heard,<br>
  Some do it with a bitter look,<br>
    Some with a flattering word.<br>
  The coward does it with a kiss,<br>
    The brave man with a sword!</p>

<p>  Some kill their love when they are young,<br>
    And some when they are old;<br>
  Some strangle with the hands of Lust,<br>
    Some with the hands of Gold:<br>
  The kindest use a knife, because<br>
    The dead so soon grow cold.</p>

<p>  Some love too little, some too long,<br>
    Some sell, and others buy;<br>
  Some do the deed with many tears,<br>
    And some without a sigh:<br>
  For each man kills the thing he loves,<br>
    Yet each man does not die.</p>

<p>  He does not die a death of shame<br>
    On a day of dark disgrace,<br>
  Nor have a noose about his neck,<br>
    Nor a cloth upon his face,<br>
  Nor drop feet foremost through the floor<br>
    Into an empty space.</p>

<p>  He does not sit with silent men<br>
    Who watch him night and day;<br>
  Who watch him when he tries to weep,<br>
    And when he tries to pray;<br>
  Who watch him lest himself should rob<br>
    The prison of its prey.</p>

<p>  He does not wake at dawn to see<br>
    Dread figures throng his room,<br>
  The shivering Chaplain robed in white,<br>
    The Sheriff stern with gloom,<br>
  And the Governor all in shiny black,<br>
    With the yellow face of Doom.</p>

<p>  He does not rise in piteous haste<br>
    To put on convict-clothes,<br>
  While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes<br>
    Each new and nerve-twitched pose,<br>
  Fingering a watch whose little ticks<br>
    Are like horrible hammer-blows.</p>

<p>  He does not feel that sickening thirst<br>
    That sands one's throat, before<br>
  The hangman with his gardener's gloves<br>
    Comes through the padded door,<br>
  And binds one with three leathern thongs,<br>
    That the throat may thirst no more.</p>

<p>  He does not bend his head to hear<br>
    The Burial Office read,<br>
  Nor, while the anguish of his soul<br>
    Tells him he is not dead,<br>
  Cross his own coffin, as he moves<br>
    Into the hideous shed.</p>

<p>  He does not stare upon the air<br>
    Through a little roof of glass:<br>
  He does not pray with lips of clay<br>
    For his agony to pass;<br>
  Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek<br>
    The kiss of Caiaphas.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>  Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard<br>
    In the suit of shabby grey:<br>
  His cricket cap was on his head,<br>
    And his step seemed light and gay,<br>
  But I never saw a man who looked<br>
    So wistfully at the day.</p>

<p>  I never saw a man who looked<br>
    With such a wistful eye<br>
  Upon that little tent of blue<br>
    Which prisoners call the sky,<br>
  And at every wandering cloud that trailed<br>
    Its ravelled fleeces by.</p>

<p>  He did not wring his hands, as do<br>
    Those witless men who dare<br>
  To try to rear the changeling<br>
    In the cave of black Despair:<br>
  He only looked upon the sun,<br>
    And drank the morning air.</p>

<p>  He did not wring his hands nor weep,<br>
    Nor did he peek or pine,<br>
  But he drank the air as though it held<br>
    Some healthful anodyne;<br>
  With open mouth he drank the sun<br>
    As though it had been wine!</p>

<p>  And I and all the souls in pain,<br>
    Who tramped the other ring,<br>
  Forgot if we ourselves had done<br>
    A great or little thing,<br>
  And watched with gaze of dull amaze<br>
    The man who had to swing.</p>

<p>  For strange it was to see him pass<br>
    With a step so light and gay,<br>
  And strange it was to see him look<br>
    So wistfully at the day,<br>
  And strange it was to think that he<br>
    Had such a debt to pay.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  For oak and elm have pleasant leaves<br>
    That in the spring-time shoot:<br>
  But grim to see is the gallows-tree,<br>
    With its adder-bitten root,<br>
  And, green or dry, a man must die<br>
    Before it bears its fruit!</p>

<p>  The loftiest place is that seat of grace<br>
    For which all worldlings try:<br>
  But who would stand in hempen band<br>
    Upon a scaffold high,<br>
  And through a murderer's collar take<br>
    His last look at the sky?</p>

<p>  It is sweet to dance to violins<br>
    When Love and Life are fair:<br>
  To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes<br>
    Is delicate and rare:<br>
  But it is not sweet with nimble feet<br>
    To dance upon the air!</p>

<p>  So with curious eyes and sick surmise<br>
    We watched him day by day,<br>
  And wondered if each one of us<br>
    Would end the self-same way,<br>
  For none can tell to what red Hell<br>
    His sightless soul may stray.</p>

<p>  At last the dead man walked no more<br>
    Amongst the Trial Men,<br>
  And I knew that he was standing up<br>
    In the black dock's dreadful pen,<br>
  And that never would I see his face<br>
    For weal or woe again.</p>

<p>  Like two doomed ships that pass in storm<br>
    We had crossed each other's way:<br>
  But we made no sign, we said no word,<br>
    We had no word to say;<br>
  For we did not meet in the holy night,<br>
    But in the shameful day.</p>

<p>  A prison wall was round us both,<br>
    Two outcast men we were:<br>
  The world had thrust us from its heart,<br>
    And God from out His care:<br>
  And the iron gin that waits for Sin<br>
    Had caught us in its snare.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>  In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,<br>
    And the dripping wall is high,<br>
  So it was there he took the air<br>
    Beneath the leaden sky,<br>
  And by each side a Warder walked,<br>
    For fear the man might die.</p>

<p>  Or else he sat with those who watched<br>
    His anguish night and day;<br>
  Who watched him when he rose to weep,<br>
    And when he crouched to pray;<br>
  Who watched him lest himself should rob<br>
    Their scaffold of its prey.</p>

<p>  The Governor was strong upon<br>
    The Regulations Act:<br>
  The Doctor said that Death was but<br>
    A scientific fact:<br>
  And twice a day the Chaplain called,<br>
    And left a little tract.</p>

<p>  And twice a day he smoked his pipe,<br>
    And drank his quart of beer:<br>
  His soul was resolute, and held<br>
    No hiding-place for fear;<br>
  He often said that he was glad<br>
    The hangman's day was near.</p>

<p>  But why he said so strange a thing<br>
    No warder dared to ask:<br>
  For he to whom a watcher's doom<br>
    Is given as his task,<br>
  Must set a lock upon his lips<br>
    And make his face a mask.</p>

<p>  Or else he might be moved, and try<br>
    To comfort or console:<br>
  And what should Human Pity do<br>
    Pent up in Murderer's Hole?<br>
  What word of grace in such a place<br>
    Could help a brother's soul?</p>

<p>  With slouch and swing around the ring<br>
    We trod the Fools' Parade!<br>
  We did not care: we knew we were<br>
    The Devil's Own Brigade:<br>
  And shaven head and feet of lead<br>
    Make a merry masquerade.</p>

<p>  We tore the tarry rope to shreds<br>
    With blunt and bleeding nails;<br>
  We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,<br>
    And cleaned the shining rails:<br>
  And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,<br>
    And clattered with the pails.</p>

<p>  We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,<br>
    We turned the dusty drill:<br>
  We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,<br>
    And sweated on the mill:<br>
  But in the heart of every man<br>
    Terror was lying still.</p>

<p>  So still it lay that every day<br>
    Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:<br>
  And we forgot the bitter lot<br>
    That waits for fool and knave,<br>
  Till once, as we tramped in from work,<br>
    We passed an open grave.</p>

<p>  With yawning mouth the yellow hole<br>
    Gaped for a living thing;<br>
  The very mud cried out for blood<br>
    To the thirsty asphalte ring:<br>
  And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair<br>
    Some prisoner had to swing.</p>

<p>  Right in we went, with soul intent<br>
    On Death and Dread and Doom:<br>
  The hangman, with his little bag,<br>
    Went shuffling through the gloom:<br>
  And I trembled as I groped my way<br>
    Into my numbered tomb.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  That night the empty corridors<br>
    Were full of forms of Fear,<br>
  And up and down the iron town<br>
    Stole feet we could not hear,<br>
  And through the bars that hide the stars<br>
    White faces seemed to peer.</p>

<p>  He lay as one who lies and dreams<br>
    In a pleasant meadow-land,<br>
  The watchers watched him as he slept,<br>
    And could not understand<br>
  How one could sleep so sweet a sleep<br>
    With a hangman close at hand.</p>

<p>  But there is no sleep when men must weep<br>
    Who never yet have wept:<br>
  So we--the fool, the fraud, the knave--<br>
    That endless vigil kept,<br>
  And through each brain on hands of pain<br>
    Another's terror crept.</p>

<p>  Alas! it is a fearful thing<br>
    To feel another's guilt!<br>
  For, right, within, the Sword of Sin<br>
    Pierced to its poisoned hilt,<br>
  And as molten lead were the tears we shed<br>
    For the blood we had not spilt.</p>

<p>  The warders with their shoes of felt<br>
    Crept by each padlocked door,<br>
  And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,<br>
    Grey figures on the floor,<br>
  And wondered why men knelt to pray<br>
    Who never prayed before.</p>

<p>  All through the night we knelt and prayed,<br>
    Mad mourners of a corse!<br>
  The troubled plumes of midnight shook<br>
    The plumes upon a hearse:<br>
  And bitter wine upon a sponge<br>
    Was the savour of Remorse.</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,<br>
    But never came the day:<br>
  And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,<br>
    In the corners where we lay:<br>
  And each evil sprite that walks by night<br>
    Before us seemed to play.</p>

<p>  They glided past, they glided fast,<br>
    Like travellers through a mist:<br>
  They mocked the moon in a rigadoon<br>
    Of delicate turn and twist,<br>
  And with formal pace and loathsome grace<br>
    The phantoms kept their tryst.</p>

<p>  With mop and mow, we saw them go,<br>
    Slim shadows hand in hand:<br>
  About, about, in ghostly rout<br>
    They trod a saraband:<br>
  And the damned grotesques made arabesques,<br>
    Like the wind upon the sand!</p>

<p>  With the pirouettes of marionettes,<br>
    They tripped on pointed tread:<br>
  But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,<br>
    As their grisly masque they led,<br>
  And loud they sang, and long they sang,<br>
    For they sang to wake the dead.</p>

<p>  <i>"Oho!" they cried, "The world is wide,<br>
    But fettered limbs go lame!<br>
  And once, or twice, to throw the dice<br>
    Is a gentlemanly game,<br>
  But he does not win who plays with Sin<br>
    In the secret House of Shame."</i></p>

<p>  No things of air these antics were,<br>
    That frolicked with such glee:<br>
  To men whose lives were held in gyves,<br>
    And whose feet might not go free,<br>
  Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,<br>
    Most terrible to see.</p>

<p>  Around, around, they waltzed and wound;<br>
    Some wheeled in smirking pairs;<br>
  With the mincing step of a demirep<br>
    Some sidled up the stairs:<br>
  And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,<br>
    Each helped us at our prayers.</p>

<p>  The morning wind began to moan,<br>
    But still the night went on:<br>
  Through its giant loom the web of gloom<br>
    Crept till each thread was spun:<br>
  And, as we prayed, we grew afraid<br>
    Of the Justice of the Sun.</p>

<p>  The moaning wind went wandering round<br>
    The weeping prison-wall:<br>
  Till like a wheel of turning steel<br>
    We felt the minutes crawl:<br>
  O moaning wind! what had we done<br>
    To have such a seneschal?</p>

<p>  At last I saw the shadowed bars,<br>
    Like a lattice wrought in lead,<br>
  Move right across the whitewashed wall<br>
    That faced my three-plank bed,<br>
  And I knew that somewhere in the world<br>
    God's dreadful dawn was red.</p>

<p>  At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,<br>
    At seven all was still,<br>
  But the sough and swing of a mighty wing<br>
    The prison seemed to fill,<br>
  For the Lord of Death with icy breath<br>
    Had entered in to kill.</p>

<p>  He did not pass in purple pomp,<br>
    Nor ride a moon-white steed.<br>
  Three yards of cord and a sliding board<br>
    Are all the gallows' need:<br>
  So with rope of shame the Herald came<br>
    To do the secret deed.</p>

<p>  We were as men who through a fen<br>
    Of filthy darkness grope:<br>
  We did not dare to breathe a prayer,<br>
    Or to give our anguish scope:<br>
  Something was dead in each of us,<br>
    And what was dead was Hope.</p>

<p>  For Man's grim Justice goes its way,<br>
    And will not swerve aside:<br>
  It slays the weak, it slays the strong,<br>
    It has a deadly stride:<br>
  With iron heel it slays the strong,<br>
    The monstrous parricide!</p>

<p>  We waited for the stroke of eight:<br>
    Each tongue was thick with thirst:<br>
  For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate<br>
    That makes a man accursed,<br>
  And Fate will use a running noose<br>
    For the best man and the worst.</p>

<p>  We had no other thing to do,<br>
    Save to wait for the sign to come:<br>
  So, like things of stone in a valley lone,<br>
    Quiet we sat and dumb:<br>
  But each man's heart beat thick and quick,<br>
    Like a madman on a drum!</p>

<p>  With sudden shock the prison-clock<br>
    Smote on the shivering air,<br>
  And from all the gaol rose up a wail<br>
    Of impotent despair,<br>
  Like the sound that frightened marches hear<br>
    From some leper in his lair.</p>

<p>  And as one sees most fearful things<br>
    In the crystal of a dream,<br>
  We saw the greasy hempen rope<br>
    Hooked to the blackened beam,<br>
  And heard the prayer the hangman's snare<br>
    Strangled into a scream.</p>

<p>  And all the woe that moved him so<br>
    That he gave that bitter cry,<br>
  And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,<br>
    None knew so well as I:<br>
  For he who lives more lives than one<br>
    More deaths than one must die.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>  There is no chapel on the day<br>
    On which they hang a man:<br>
  The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,<br>
    Or his face is far too wan,<br>
  Or there is that written in his eyes<br>
    Which none should look upon.</p>

<p>  So they kept us close till nigh on noon,<br>
    And then they rang the bell,<br>
  And the warders with their jingling keys<br>
    Opened each listening cell,<br>
  And down the iron stair we tramped,<br>
    Each from his separate Hell.</p>

<p>  Out into God's sweet air we went,<br>
    But not in wonted way,<br>
  For this man's face was white with fear,<br>
    And that man's face was grey,<br>
  And I never saw sad men who looked<br>
    So wistfully at the day.</p>

<p>  I never saw sad men who looked<br>
    With such a wistful eye<br>
  Upon that little tent of blue<br>
    We prisoners called the sky,<br>
  And at every happy cloud that passed<br>
    In such strange freedom by.</p>

<p>  But there were those amongst us all<br>
    Who walked with downcast head,<br>
  And knew that, had each got his due,<br>
    They should have died instead:<br>
  He had but killed a thing that lived,<br>
    Whilst they had killed the dead.</p>

<p>  For he who sins a second time<br>
    Wakes a dead soul to pain,<br>
  And draws it from its spotted shroud,<br>
    And makes it bleed again,<br>
  And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,<br>
    And makes it bleed in vain!</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb<br>
    With crooked arrows starred,<br>
  Silently we went round and round<br>
    The slippery asphalte yard;<br>
  Silently we went round and round,<br>
    And no man spoke a word.</p>

<p>  Silently we went round and round,<br>
    And through each hollow mind<br>
  The Memory of dreadful things<br>
    Rushed like a dreadful wind,<br>
  And Horror stalked before each man,<br>
    And Terror crept behind.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  The warders strutted up and down,<br>
    And watched their herd of brutes,<br>
  Their uniforms were spick and span,<br>
    And they wore their Sunday suits,<br>
  But we knew the work they had been at,<br>
    By the quicklime on their boots.</p>

<p>  For where a grave had opened wide,<br>
    There was no grave at all:<br>
  Only a stretch of mud and sand<br>
    By the hideous prison-wall,<br>
  And a little heap of burning lime,<br>
    That the man should have his pall.</p>

<p>  For he has a pall, this wretched man,<br>
    Such as few men can claim:<br>
  Deep down below a prison-yard,<br>
    Naked for greater shame,<br>
  He lies, with fetters on each foot,<br>
    Wrapt in a sheet of flame!</p>

<p>  And all the while the burning lime<br>
    Eats flesh and bone away,<br>
  It eats the brittle bone by night,<br>
    And the soft flesh by day,<br>
  It eats the flesh and bone by turns,<br>
    But it eats the heart alway.</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  For three long years they will not sow<br>
    Or root or seedling there:<br>
  For three long years the unblessed spot<br>
    Will sterile be and bare,<br>
  And look upon the wondering sky<br>
    With unreproachful stare.</p>

<p>  They think a murderer's heart would taint<br>
    Each simple seed they sow.<br>
  It is not true! God's kindly earth<br>
    Is kindlier than men know,<br>
  And the red rose would but blow more red,<br>
    The white rose whiter blow.</p>

<p>  Out of his mouth a red, red rose!<br>
    Out of his heart a white!<br>
  For who can say by what strange way,<br>
    Christ brings His will to light,<br>
  Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore<br>
    Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?</p>

<p>  But neither milk-white rose nor red<br>
    May bloom in prison-air;<br>
  The shard, the pebble, and the flint,<br>
    Are what they give us there:<br>
  For flowers have been known to heal<br>
    A common man's despair.</p>

<p>  So never will wine-red rose or white,<br>
    Petal by petal, fall<br>
  On that stretch of mud and sand that lies<br>
    By the hideous prison-wall,<br>
  To tell the men who tramp the yard<br>
    That God's Son died for all.</p>

<p>  Yet though the hideous prison-wall<br>
    Still hems him round and round,<br>
  And a spirit may not walk by night<br>
    That is with fetters bound,<br>
  And a spirit may but weep that lies<br>
    In such unholy ground.</p>

<p>  He is at peace-this wretched man--<br>
    At peace, or will be soon:<br>
  There is no thing to make him mad,<br>
    Nor does Terror walk at noon,<br>
  For the lampless Earth in which he lies<br>
    Has neither Sun nor Moon.</p>

<p>  They hanged him as a beast is hanged:<br>
    They did not even toll<br>
  A requiem that might have brought<br>
    Rest to his startled soul,<br>
  But hurriedly they took him out,<br>
    And hid him in a hole.</p>

<p>  The warders stripped him of his clothes,<br>
    And gave him to the flies:<br>
  They mocked the swollen purple throat,<br>
    And the stark and staring eyes:<br>
  And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud<br>
    In which the convict lies.</p>

<p>  The Chaplain would not kneel to pray<br>
    By his dishonoured grave:<br>
  Nor mark it with that blessed Cross<br>
    That Christ for sinners gave,<br>
  Because the man was one of those<br>
    Whom Christ came down to save.</p>

<p>  Yet all is well; he has but passed<br>
    To Life's appointed bourne:<br>
  And alien tears will fill for him<br>
    Pity's long-broken urn,<br>
  For his mourners will be outcast men,<br>
    And outcasts always mourn.</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>  I know not whether Laws be right,<br>
    Or whether Laws be wrong;<br>
  All that we know who lie in gaol<br>
    Is that the wall is strong;<br>
  And that each day is like a year,<br>
    A year whose days are long.</p>

<p>  But this I know, that every Law<br>
    That men have made for Man,<br>
  Since first Man took his brother's life,<br>
    And the sad world began,<br>
  But straws the wheat and saves the chaff<br>
    With a most evil fan.</p>

<p>  This too I know--and wise it were<br>
    If each could know the same--<br>
  That every prison that men build<br>
    Is built with bricks of shame,<br>
  And bound with bars lest Christ should see<br>
    How men their brothers maim.</p>

<p>  With bars they blur the gracious moon,<br>
    And blind the goodly sun:<br>
  And they do well to hide their Hell,<br>
    For in it things are done<br>
  That Son of God nor son of Man<br>
    Ever should look upon!</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  The vilest deeds like poison weeds,<br>
    Bloom well in prison-air;<br>
  It is only what is good in Man<br>
    That wastes and withers there:<br>
  Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,<br>
    And the Warder is Despair.</p>

<p>  For they starve the little frightened child<br>
    Till it weeps both night and day:<br>
  And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,<br>
    And gibe the old and grey,<br>
  And some grow mad, and all grow bad,<br>
    And none a word may say.</p>

<p>  Each narrow cell in which we dwell<br>
    Is a foul and dark latrine,<br>
  And the fetid breath of living Death<br>
    Chokes up each grated screen,<br>
  And all, but Lust, is turned to dust<br>
    In humanity's machine.</p>

<p>  The brackish water that we drink<br>
   Creeps with a loathsome slime,<br>
  And the bitter bread they weigh in scales<br>
   Is full of chalk and lime,<br>
  And Sleep will not lie down, but walks<br>
   Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  But though lean Hunger and green Thirst<br>
   Like asp with adder fight,<br>
  We have little care of prison fare,<br>
   For what chills and kills outright<br>
  Is that every stone one lifts by day<br>
   Becomes one's heart by night.</p>

<p>  With midnight always in one's heart,<br>
   And twilight in one's cell,<br>
  We turn the crank, or tear the rope,<br>
   Each in his separate Hell,<br>
  And the silence is more awful far<br>
   Than the sound of a brazen bell.</p>

<p>  And never a human voice comes near<br>
   To speak a gentle word:<br>
  And the eye that watches through the door<br>
   Is pitiless and hard:<br>
  And by all forgot, we rot and rot,<br>
   With soul and body marred.</p>

<p>  And thus we rust Life's iron chain<br>
   Degraded and alone:<br>
  And some men curse and some men weep,<br>
    And some men make no moan:<br>
  But God's eternal Laws are kind<br>
    And break the heart of stone.</p>

<p>  And every human heart that breaks,<br>
    In prison-cell or yard,<br>
  Is as that broken box that gave<br>
    Its treasure to the Lord,<br>
  And filled the unclean leper's house<br>
    With the scent of costliest nard.</p>

<p>  Ah! happy they whose hearts can break<br>
    And peace of pardon win!<br>
  How else man may make straight his plan<br>
    And cleanse his soul from Sin?<br>
  How else but through a broken heart<br>
    May Lord Christ enter in?</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  And he of the swollen purple throat,<br>
    And the stark and staring eyes,<br>
  Waits for the holy hands that took<br>
    The Thief to Paradise;<br>
  And a broken and a contrite heart<br>
    The Lord will not despise.</p>

<p>  The man in red who reads the Law<br>
    Gave him three weeks of life,<br>
  Three little weeks in which to heal<br>
    His soul of his soul's strife,<br>
  And cleanse from every blot of blood<br>
    The hand that held the knife.</p>

<p>  And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,<br>
    The hand that held the steel:<br>
  For only blood can wipe out blood,<br>
    And only tears can heal:<br>
  And the crimson stain that was of Cain<br>
    Became Christ's snow-white seal.</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p>  In Reading gaol by Reading town<br>
    There is a pit of shame,<br>
  And in it lies a wretched man<br>
    Eaten by teeth of flame,<br>
  In a burning winding-sheet he lies,<br>
    And his grave has got no name.</p>

<p>  And there, till Christ call forth the dead,<br>
    In silence let him lie:<br>
  No need to waste the foolish tear,<br>
    Or heave the windy sigh:<br>
  The man had killed the thing he loved,<br>
    And so he had to die.</p>

<p>  And all men kill the thing they love,<br>
    By all let this be heard,<br>
  Some do it with a bitter look,<br>
    Some with a flattering word,<br>
  The coward does it with a kiss,<br>
    The brave man with a sword!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
